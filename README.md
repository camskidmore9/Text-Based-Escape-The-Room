# Text-Based-Escape-The-Room
A text based escape the room game that I made in my junior year of high school in my first programming class

This was my first large programming project I ever attempted.
The object of the game is to move around the digital space and find object and solve puzzles in order to escape

There is not much else to say about this code, I would love to go through and re-do this concept someday. Maybe I will, we'll see
